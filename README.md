# Orpheus's Journey
Side-scrolling 2D platformer inspired by the mythological story of Orpheus

Made as a final project for my classical civilization class for which the requirement was to "make something inspired by ancient greek or roman myth"
Roughly 2 minutes of intense sidescrolling, lyre-playing, lava-jumping gameplay. 

To play you can download this repo and run 
```
pip install pygame
pip install pypng
python3 main.py
```
or alternatively I have a singular Windows executable, built with pyinstaller, available to download on my site jcrowell.net, under the "Projects" section.

Move and jump with ← → ↑ , play the lyre with X
